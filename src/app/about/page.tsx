                    <p>I have been working with Front-end technologies for approximately 2 years. During this time, I have utilized
                        technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, Less, Bootstrap, Tailwind, jQuery, Git, GitHub, React,
                        TypeScript, and Next.js. My career goals include developing Full-Stack applications using Node.js and
                        MongoDB, and gaining in-depth knowledge in this area. Additionally, I plan to expand my expertise by working
                        on projects with React Native in the field of mobile application development.
